Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The application was an inventory app, meant to be used by a warehouse team to maintain their inventory. They wanted to be able to create items, as well as update descriptions and item quantities as inventory changed.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- I designed this app with a main screen, which contained a list of all items, as well as an option to create a new item. The new item detail screen allowed users to create a new item, with a Name, Description and Quantity. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
- Coding this app mostly stemmed from the design and layout views in Android Studio. I took the approach of building an intuitive UI first, then developing the functionality for the UI behind the scenes. This approach helped me gague user requirements and build UI to meet needs as I thought of them. This adaptive approach to design meant a quicker turnaround time, and allowed me to focus on the UI first, while giving myself time to focus on the programming in one solid session.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
- Developing tests for ensuring app functionality is a key aspect of software development in all fields. Thankfully, Android Studio provides a virtualized Android device, which developers can use to test the user interface and ensure functionality when UI elements are pressed. However, developing test cases is still important, and a more complex app would likely require a robust testing platform to ensure development changes work within the app continuously as they are implemented.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- I'm glad I was able to design and implement effective database storage using SQLite. Being able to develop persistent item storage meant the app would be much more usable, with the app holding information across login sessions.
